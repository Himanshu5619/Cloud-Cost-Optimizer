# Cloud-Cost-Optimizer
Cloud environments often suffer from unnecessary costs due to continuously running idle resources.
Manual monitoring and cost control are inefficient and error-prone. The Smart Cloud Cost Optimizer is an
automated cloud-based solution that monitors resource utilization and optimizes cloud costs by intelligently
managing underutilized compute resources. Using real-time monitoring and serverless automation, the
system performs automated start and stop operations while maintaining operational efficiency and cost
effectiveness.. The purpose of this project is to develop an autonomous, serverless system that aligns
resource availability with actual demand, ensuring a true "pay-only-for-what-you-use" model.
